# Global-Debt-analysis
This project, Global Risk Assessment, leverages Power BI to analyze global credit and debt dynamics. It provides a comprehensive overview of top creditor and debtor countries, the distribution of debt among debtor nations, and the associated risk levels. Key insights include identifying the highest exposure to high-risk debts, understanding bilateral debt relationships, and analyzing how debt is concentrated or spread across different countries. This report is a valuable resource for financial analysts, policymakers, economists, credit risk managers, and international financial institutions, offering actionable data to inform strategic decision-making in the global financial landscape.
